# Hanoi Towers:

There are three rods A, B, C and N discs of different diameters, initially stacked on rod A
in descending order of diameters, forming a cone. Determine the sequence of moves
of the disks from the initial rod A to the final rod C, using B as the intermediate rod,
having regard to the following restrictions:

     a. each move will change the position of only a single disc
     b. a disc can only be placed on a disc larger in diameter
